Here's a **Replit prompt** for creating a **BPMN 2.0 process flow diagram platform** using JSON with **add/edit/delete** functionality, and **localStorage** for persistence. This is ideal for a small front-end focused project using JavaScript, HTML, and the [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) library.

### üß† Replit Prompt: BPMN 2.0 JSON Diagram Editor

**Title**: BPMN 2.0 Diagram Editor with JSON Storage

**Prompt**:

Create a web-based BPMN 2.0 process flow diagram editor that allows users to:

* ‚úÖ Create new BPMN diagrams from scratch.
* ‚úèÔ∏è Add, edit, and delete BPMN elements (like tasks, gateways, events).
* üì• Import/export BPMN diagrams as JSON.
* üíæ Save diagrams to `localStorage` so they persist across sessions.

Use the open-source [`bpmn-js`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) library for rendering and interacting with BPMN 2.0 diagrams.

---

### üí° Features

* Interactive BPMN 2.0 canvas.
* Buttons or UI for **Add / Edit / Delete** elements.
* Export the diagram as JSON to view or reuse.
* Automatically **save to and load from localStorage**.
* Optionally show the raw BPMN XML or JSON representation.

---

### üõ† Tech Stack

* HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Vanilla or with a front-end framework like React)
* [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js)
* Browser `localStorage` API

---

### üß© Starter Tasks

1. Setup a basic HTML page and include `bpmn-js` via CDN or npm.
2. Initialize the BPMN modeler and load a blank diagram.
3. Add buttons for "Add Task", "Delete Element", and "Save to LocalStorage".
4. Implement JSON export/import functionality using the modeler APIs.
5. Persist the diagram data in `localStorage` and reload on page refresh.
